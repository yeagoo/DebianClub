<ReleaseTimeline />

<Callout type="info" title="Date baseline">

This page is based on official Debian release information as of **2026-07-01**. Regular security support for Debian 12 (Bookworm) is scheduled until **2026-07-11**, and LTS is scheduled until **2028-06-30**. Treat [Debian Releases](https://www.debian.org/releases/) and [Debian LTS](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) as the final sources.

</Callout>

EOL does not mean the system immediately stops running. It means the security maintenance and bug-fix responsibility boundary has changed. For internet-facing services, office desktops, development environments, and home servers, understanding the support lifecycle prevents systems from being left unmaintained.

## Debian Support Phases

| Phase | Meaning | Appropriate state |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| stable | Current stable release, maintained by the Debian Security Team | New deployments, production, daily systems |
| oldstable | Previous stable release, still in the regular maintenance window | Transition period for existing systems |
| LTS | Long-Term Support after regular security support ends | Migration runway, not a reason to postpone indefinitely |
| ELTS | Extended LTS, usually provided by third-party commercial services | Special legacy systems |
| EOL | Public security support has ended | Upgrade, replace, isolate, or retire |

## Quick Dates

| Codename | Release date | Regular security support ends | LTS ends | Current advice |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Debian 13 (Trixie) | 2025-08-09 | Estimated around 2028 | Estimated around 2030 | Preferred for new deployments |
| Debian 12 (Bookworm) | 2023-06-10 | 2026-07-11 | 2028-06-30 | Plan Debian 13 upgrade |
| Debian 11 (Bullseye) | 2021-08-14 | Ended | 2026-08-31 | Migrate soon |
| Debian 10 (Buster) | 2019-07-06 | Ended | 2024-06-30 | Should not remain internet-facing |
| Debian 9 (Stretch) | 2017-06-17 | Ended | 2022-06-30 | Retire or isolate |
| Debian 8 (Jessie) | 2015-04-25 | Ended | 2020-06-30 | Retire or isolate |

Debian 13 regular support and LTS dates are estimates and should be updated when Debian publishes final dates.

## What Changes During LTS

LTS provides more migration time, but it is not a full replacement for stable:

- LTS support may not cover every package in the Debian archive.
- Some desktop applications, developer tools, or niche services may be outside the support scope.
- LTS is best used to stay secure while migration completes, not to keep adding new workloads.
- For internet-facing systems, the start of LTS should be treated as an upgrade countdown.

## 90-Day EOL Checklist

| Check | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Asset inventory | Find machines still running old releases |
| Service inventory | Flag public services, databases, CI, bastion hosts, and backup nodes |
| Package support scope | Confirm critical packages remain supported during LTS |
| Upgrade path | Upgrade Debian 11 to 12, then 13; avoid skipping multiple stable releases |
| Backup restore | Confirm backups can be restored, not only that backup files exist |
| Maintenance window | Prepare console or rescue access for servers and remote machines |
| Rollback plan | Prepare snapshots, images, configuration backups, or replacement hardware |

## Actions By System Type

| System type | Before EOL |
|-------------|------------|
| Internet-facing server | Upgrade or migrate early; do not wait until the last LTS month |
| Internal service | Evaluate network isolation, access limits, and upgrade timing |
| Desktop computer | Move to current stable so browsers and desktop apps do not lag for years |
| Lab / classroom machine | Reimaging is often faster than multi-step upgrades |
| Legacy device | If it cannot be upgraded, isolate it and restrict exposed services |

## Pre-upgrade Commands

```bash
cat /etc/debian_version
apt update
apt list --upgradable
dpkg --audit
apt-mark showhold
systemctl --failed
df -h
```

If these checks already report errors, fix the current system before attempting a major release upgrade.
